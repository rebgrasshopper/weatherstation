## Introduction ##

This project can be accessed from any browser on an internet-connected device. It uses a form to accept user input, and takes that information to query the openweathermap api with ajax. It uses three APIs from openweathermap: 
- Current weather: https://openweathermap.org/api
- UV Index: https://openweathermap.org/api/uvi
- 5 day forecast: https://openweathermap.org/forecast5
as well as dynamically updated html and css via jquery and javascript. A mix of bootstrap and raw css is used to make the application responsive.

## Usage ##

The source files for this quiz can be accessed through cloning the GitHub repo. The link above will take you to the deployed project.
